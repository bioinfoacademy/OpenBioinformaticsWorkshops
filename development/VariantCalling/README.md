# Overview

This is a single-day workshop on variant calling. It is designed to go from experimental design through data processing and SNP, indel, and SV calling. It assumes only a basic familiarity with genomics and NGS concepts.

# Status

I taught this workshop once, and did not get all the way through the slides. Thus the slides need some revision to make the first two sections (experimental design, library prep and sequencing) about 45 min shorter.

Currently, the presentation is in PPT format. The current goal is to convert the slides into Remark.js. The next goal is to create a SWC-style narrative for the workshop.

Another issue is how to host the data files. Currently they are on my computer and backed up to a dropbox folder.
